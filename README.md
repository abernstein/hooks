Random Hooks Used to Manage Specific Types of Projects

If you are looking to manage a complex project with hooks for different languages, this may be a good starting place.
You will probably need to merge a few of these together if your project contains different file types.

# Install

Add separate include hooks directly/manually to your trigger (pre-commit)
```
<path_to_hooks>/hooks and/or <path_to_hooks>/module/*/hooks
```

or
```
git clone <repo>; cd $_; sudo bash ./install.sh
```
